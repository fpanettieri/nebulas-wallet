## Overview
The Nebulas Wallet is composed of 3 main components:

1. Browser Extension: Used to store NAS and run dApps.
2. Smart Contract: Sends seed funds to new wallets.
3. Web Page: Helps new users get started.

## Motivation
Nebulas is an amazing technology from a developer point of view.
However the first steps for end users can be a little daunting.
This project aims to help both worlds: Kick start new developers, allowing them to upload dApps faster, while helping new users start using nebulas dApps with 2 clicks.

## Seed funds
The first 1.000.000 users of the Nebulas Wallet will receive 100 Gwei (0.0000001 NAS). This should be enough to deploy a fairly complex smart contract on the mainnet, or call a few dApp methods. Funds are distributed on request to new wallets on the next minted block.
